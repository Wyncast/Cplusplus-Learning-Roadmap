# Cplusplus-Tutorial-Roadmap

This is my roadmap for learning C++ from scratch without any programming knowledge. I will be getting input from ChatGPT for the roadmap. Then later from Professional Software Developers that I talk to on stream. Every other hour I will be talking to ESL Software Developers which will tutor me. With the last couple of hours just solo learning. I will be streaming on twitch.tv/wyncast my journey from zero to hero.
